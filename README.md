# Personal Training Virtual Platform

**Current Site:** https://pt-platform-wilkija.vercel.app/

NOTE: This project is a work in progress with the goal of commiting 100 hours to reach the MVP.

This is a full stack web application that is meant to serve as a interface for independent personal trainers to run a virtual business. It allows trainers to:
* Build and manage a client base
* Build and manage a database of exercises
* Program workouts with linked exercises to provide clear instruction
* Assign workouts to clients to aid in long-term periodization of fitness routine

This application expands upon a proof of concept for both the exercise library and activity tracking features that I have explored in previous work. You can see renditions of earlier drafts in the two repositories below.

**Exercise Library:** https://github.com/wilkija/exercise-library-api-v1

**Activity Tracker:** https://github.com/wilkija/activity-tracker

## Tech Used:
Nextjs, React, Node, MongoDB, JavaScript, TailwindCSS

## Future Work 
* Modulize the CSS for each component
* Add Personal Training client views
